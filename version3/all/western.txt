Snow in my shoe Abandoned Sparrowâ€™s nest
Whitecaps on the bay: A broken signboard banging In the April wind. 
Lily:out of the waterout of itself
Bass picking bugs off the moon
quail excitedin dirt turned up by a gopher
ground squirrel balancing its tomato on the garden fence
Just friends:he watches my gauze dress blowing on the line
A little boy sings on a terrace, eyes aglow. Ridge spills upward.
meteor shower a gentle wave wets our sandals
